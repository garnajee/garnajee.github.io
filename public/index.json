It\u0026rsquo;s focused on their critical analysis and explores strategies for their assessment and mitigation. Through rigorous research and practical exploration, the project aims to contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity practices, equipping future professionals with essential insights and methodologies to safeguard against evolving threats within the Windows operating environment.\nIntroduction In the intricate landscape of operating systems, Windows drivers serve as crucial components, facilitating seamless communication between hardware and software. These drivers bridge the gap between user applications and hardware peripherals, enabling essential functions such as graphics rendering, network communication, and device management. Without drivers, the interaction between the operating system and hardware components would be impossible, underscoring their pivotal role in system functionality and performance.\nReverse engineering emerges as a pivotal technique in scrutinizing the intricate workings of Windows drivers. By dissecting operational software components, reverse engineering endeavors to unravel the technical intricacies and functional specifications embedded within drivers. This process facilitates a deeper understanding of driver behavior, enabling researchers and developers to identify vulnerabilities, deprecated code, and potential security loopholes.\nDespite their indispensable role, Windows drivers harbor inherent vulnerabilities that can compromise system integrity and expose users to security risks. Malicious actors often exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code within the system. Securing Windows drivers assumes paramount importance in fortifying system resilience against evolving cyber threats and safeguarding user data and privacy.\n1. Understanding the Windows Driver Security 1.1. Kernel-level drivers: WDM vs. WDF Within the Windows operating system, drivers operate at varying privilege levels, with kernel-level drivers holding the highest level of access and responsibility. Two primary frameworks for developing kernel-level drivers in Windows are the Windows Driver Model (WDM) and the Windows Driver Framework (WDF).\nWindows Driver Model (WDM): WDM drivers are a traditional approach to developing drivers for Windows operating systems. They interact closely with the operating system kernel and directly access hardware resources. Due to their direct interaction with system components, WDM drivers require precise memory management and error handling to prevent system crashes and vulnerabilities. The development of WDM drivers necessitates a deep understanding of system architecture and kernel programming, making them prone to errors and vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.\nIn the architecture of WDM drivers, the DriverEntry function serves as the primary initialization routine, responsible for setting up the driver environment and initializing driver-specific data structures. WDM drivers interact with the operating system kernel through dispatch routines linked to various IRP (I/O Request Packet) codes, enabling communication and interaction with hardware devices.\nWDM drivers rely on pointers to system objects and structures, often referenced directly within the driver code. The model is implicit, with roles (physical, functional, or filter) determined implicitly by the driver\u0026rsquo;s behavior. Context management in WDM drivers involves configuring context zones within driver-specific data structures, where synchronization and concurrency control require manual implementation using locks and synchronization primitives.\nWindows Driver Framework (WDF): Introduced as a more structured and secure framework for driver development, WDF offers higher-level abstractions and simplifies driver development. WDF drivers interact with the system through framework-provided APIs, reducing the likelihood of direct errors in memory management and resource allocation. By abstracting complex interactions with the system, WDF drivers promote safer and more reliable driver development practices. WDF drivers benefit from built-in error handling and resource management capabilities, minimizing the risk of common driver-related vulnerabilities.\nIn contrast to WDM, WDF incorporates the driver\u0026rsquo;s entry point within the framework itself, simplifying initialization through event callback functions such as EvtDriverDeviceAdd for Plug and Play scenarios. Dispatch routines in WDF drivers are managed by the framework, reducing the burden on developers and ensuring consistent behavior across different driver implementations.\nThe object-oriented model in WDF introduces an opaque structure, where drivers interact with objects through handles provided by the framework. Object roles (physical, functional, or filter) are explicit and defined through event callback functions corresponding to each role. WDF also offers built-in support for context management, with configurable context zones for storing driver-specific data associated with each object instance. Synchronization is integrated into the framework, reducing the need for explicit locking mechanisms and minimizing the risk of synchronization-related issues.\n1.2. Exploiting Vulnerable Drivers: The BYOVD Attack 1.2.1. Understanding the BYOVD Threat The Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack represents a sophisticated method of exploiting vulnerable drivers within the Windows operating system. In this attack, perpetrators surreptitiously introduce legitimate, yet compromised, drivers onto target systems. Once deployed, these drivers operate at the highest privilege level, known as ring 0, within the system\u0026rsquo;s kernel. What makes BYOVD particularly insidious is its ability to evade traditional security measures. Legitimate drivers, even when compromised, are not inherently flagged by conventional security solutions, allowing attackers to operate undetected.\n1.2.2. The Significance of BYOVD Vulnerabilities The gravest danger posed by BYOVD lies in its exploitation of signed certificates. Historically, signed certificates have served as a hallmark of trust and security within the Windows ecosystem. However, recent attacks have underscored their fallibility. Despite being certified, drivers can harbor critical vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subvert system defenses. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities enables attackers to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, posing severe risks to system integrity and data confidentiality.\n2. Addressing Windows Driver Vulnerabilities 2.1. Evaluation of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Response Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s response to driver vulnerabilities primarily revolves around certification programs such as the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) and Extended Validation (EV). While these programs aim to ensure driver compatibility and security, their effectiveness remains limited. Recent attacks have demonstrated that certified drivers may still harbor vulnerabilities, as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s certification process does not comprehensively scrutinize driver code for potential flaws.\n2.2. Current Research Efforts and Limitations Despite concerted research efforts, the field of Windows driver vulnerability mitigation faces significant challenges. Existing tools and methodologies, while valuable, often fall short of providing comprehensive solutions. Automated vulnerability assessment tools, such as Popkorn and Screwed Drivers, offer insights into potential vulnerabilities but lack the capacity to analyze both Windows Driver Model (WDM) and Windows Driver Framework (WDF) drivers effectively.\nCurrent research efforts in vulnerability assessment of Windows drivers have yielded promising developments, yet they also face inherent limitations that warrant attention and consideration. In this section, we delve into the methodologies employed by recent tools and highlight their strengths and limitations.\nTAU Methodology:\nIn October 31st, 2023, an article on the VMWare blog introduced TAU, a novel tool developed by Takahiro Haruyama aimed at automating the detection of vulnerabilities in WDM and WDF x64 drivers. TAU leverages IDA Pro scripts to conduct comprehensive vulnerability hunts, focusing on the unique characteristics of WDF drivers. Despite being open-source, TAU\u0026rsquo;s accessibility is restricted due to its dependency on IDA Pro. However, Haruyama\u0026rsquo;s insights into TAU\u0026rsquo;s functionality have unveiled a distinct methodology for vulnerability hunting in WDF drivers, tailored to address their specific nuances. TAU also aims to address the limitations of existing tools like ScrewedDrivers by Eclypsium, which primarily target WDM drivers. By filling potential gaps in ScrewedDrivers' capabilities, TAU represents a significant advancement in vulnerability assessment methodologies for Windows drivers.\nScrewedDrivers Methodology:\nEclypsium\u0026rsquo;s ScrewedDrivers tool has been instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities in Windows drivers, particularly within the WDM framework. However, its applicability to WDF drivers is limited, as it primarily relies on symbolic execution with Angr, which may lead to \u0026ldquo;path explosions, false negatives, and other unknown errors.\u0026rdquo; While ScrewedDrivers has contributed significantly to driver security, its effectiveness in analyzing WDF drivers remains constrained by the complexities inherent in the framework.\nDespite the advancements represented by tools like TAU and ScrewedDrivers, achieving full automation in vulnerability assessment remains a formidable challenge. Even with TAU\u0026rsquo;s introduction, manual verification remains indispensable due to the intricate nature of WDF drivers and the potential for overlooked vulnerabilities. As the field continues to evolve, researchers and developers must navigate these limitations while striving to enhance the efficacy and reliability of vulnerability assessment methodologies for Windows drivers.\n3. Strategies for Vulnerability Assessment and Mitigation 3.1. Standards and Challenges in Driver Development The establishment of standards, such as WHQL and EV, represents a crucial step in mitigating driver vulnerabilities. However, these standards alone are insufficient in addressing the evolving threat landscape. Vulnerabilities persist even in certified drivers, highlighting the need for more rigorous code verification processes and comprehensive security measures.\n3.2. Assessing Vulnerability Assessment Methodologies Current vulnerability assessment methodologies, including TAU and Popkorn, offer valuable insights into driver vulnerabilities. However, their effectiveness varies, and improvements are necessary to enhance their scope and accuracy. Future efforts should focus on refining analysis techniques and expanding the toolsets to encompass a broader range of drivers, including WDF drivers.\n4. Advancements in Vulnerability Research Automation 4.1. Current Landscape and Research Gaps Despite recent advancements, the vulnerability research landscape remains fragmented, with notable gaps in analyzing WDF drivers effectively. Open-source projects like Popkorn have shown promise in identifying vulnerabilities but require enhancements to address the complexities of WDF drivers comprehensively. Here is a summary of the state of the art projects:\nPopkorn Screwed Drivers TAU Open Source ✅ ✅ ✅ Free ✅ ✅ ❌ Scope WDM WDM WDM + WDF Frameworks used Angr Angr, Radare2, objdump IDA Pro Fully Automated ✅ ❌ ❌ 4.2. Advancements in the Popkorn Tool Since its inception, the Popkorn tool has undergone significant enhancements and validations to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities within Windows drivers. This section highlights the key advancements made to the Popkorn tool, including exact reproduction of results, environment updates, and the utilization of a new dataset.\n4.2.1. Exact Reproduction of Results The initial phase of the project focused on replicating the results presented in the research paper, serving as a benchmark to validate the tool\u0026rsquo;s functionality. The Popkorn tool and dataset were retrieved from the developers\u0026rsquo; GitHub repository, facilitating an in-depth analysis of its capabilities. The reproduction yielded the following results:\nMetrics Original Test New Identical Test Number of drivers used 212 271 Unique bugs found 38 37 Timeouts 60 - While the results deviated slightly from the initial expectations, with the number of drivers and unique bugs differing marginally, the tool demonstrated consistent performance across both tests. The discrepancies in results underscored the importance of meticulous validation and testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the tool.\n4.2.2. Test Environment Update In response to the evolving technological landscape, the test environment underwent comprehensive updates to maintain compatibility and functionality with the latest software versions. The technical updates included:\nUbuntu updated from 20.04 to 22.04 Python upgraded from 3.8 to 3.12 Virtualwrapper replaced by python3.12-venv Python libraries updated, including angr, ipython, and ipdb Following the environment updates, the Popkorn tool was subjected to a new test using the updated configuration. The results demonstrated consistency in vulnerability detection, reaffirming the tool\u0026rsquo;s efficacy in identifying potential threats within Windows drivers.\nMetrics Original Test New Updated Test Number of drivers used 212 271 Unique bugs found 38 38 The alignment of results between the original and updated tests underscored the robustness and adaptability of the Popkorn tool to evolving software environments.\n4.2.3. Creation of a New Dataset As part of the ongoing enhancements, a new dataset comprising Windows Driver Framework (WDF) drivers was curated to expand the scope of analysis and address potential blind spots. The dataset collection process involved gathering drivers from the team\u0026rsquo;s computer, focusing on drivers located in C://Windows/System32/drivers. The analysis of the new dataset yielded the following insights:\nMetrics Result Number of drivers 454 No sinks found 141 Timeouts 9 Not vulnerable 304 The analysis revealed that the majority of drivers within the dataset were deemed safe from vulnerabilities identified by Popkorn. However, the presence of timeouts underscored the need for further investigation and refinement of the analysis methodology, particularly concerning WDF drivers.\nThe advancements in the Popkorn tool, including exact reproduction of results, environment updates, and utilization of a new dataset, signify a significant stride towards enhancing the efficacy and reliability of vulnerability assessment in Windows drivers. These enhancements pave the way for more robust cybersecurity measures, mitigating potential threats and safeguarding critical systems against evolving vulnerabilities.\n4.3. Understanding Limitations and Challenges Despite notable advancements, automated vulnerability assessment tools face inherent limitations. Challenges include scope limitations, false negatives, and the complexity of detecting vulnerabilities within WDF drivers. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to refine analysis techniques and develop more robust mitigation strategies.\n4.4. Proposing Future Improvements Future improvements in vulnerability research automation should prioritize expanding the scope of analysis to include WDF drivers, enhancing detection capabilities, and refining analysis methodologies. Additionally, efforts to incorporate advanced techniques, such as identifying potential BYOVD attacks, are essential for safeguarding against emerging threats effectively.\nConclusion In conclusion, addressing Windows driver vulnerabilities demands a multifaceted approach encompassing stringent standards, advanced research methodologies, and continuous innovation in vulnerability assessment tools. By understanding the nuances of driver security threats and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, the cybersecurity community can mitigate risks and fortify systems against emerging threats effectively.\nWe hope that this article has provided valuable insights into the intricate landscape of Windows driver security and the methodologies employed in vulnerability research.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but that\u0026rsquo;s the only way I can get it to work.\nRead more here.\nJellyseerr Follow the steps, it\u0026rsquo;s easy.\nSign in with your Jellyfin account and make sure to use the jellyfin internal docker ip address for the \u0026ldquo;Jellyfin URL\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen Syncing Librairies, uncheck \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo;.\nThen, add your radarr and sonarr server (still with the internal docker ip address).\nOnce this is done, you can sync Jellyfin users with Jellyseerr, so that they have the same account for Jellyfin and Jellyseerr.\nFor sonarr server settings, make sure to check Season folder.\nBonus Don\u0026rsquo;t want to use a reverse proxy?\nYou can use a VPN:\nOfficial Synology VPN package -\u0026gt; need to open port on your router And if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to open port on your router (or if you can\u0026rsquo;t):\nTailscale on Synology CloudFlare Tunnel Pay attention to not use CloudFlare tunnel for Jellyfin streaming, you may be banned for breaking TOS.\nWebhooks I provide some webhooks for Jellyfin. These webhooks are used for:\nDiscord Microsoft Teams WhatsApp (old-method) WhatsApp (new-method) First of all, you need to install the Jellyfin plugin called \u0026ldquo;Webhooks\u0026rdquo;: Jellyfin \u0026gt; Dashboard \u0026gt; Plugins \u0026gt; Catalog \u0026gt; Webhook\nThen, you need to restart Jellyfin:\n$ cd /opt/chill/ $ docker-compose restart jellyfin Now, go back to Jellyfin in the Plugins tab and click on Webhook.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Server Url\u0026rdquo; is your Jellyfin URL. If you expose it on internet, it\u0026rsquo;s something like this: https://yourdomainname.com/jellyfin\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a domain name, Jellyfin will not be able to display images (posters) in the Discord/Teams webhooks.\nGlobal Webhook This method will allow you to send a webhook to any service/api you want in a very easy way.\nThis consists of using your own API and create your request in Python (which is more flexible than the Jellyfin Webhook plugin) and send it to the API you want.\nTo do this you will need to modify as your needs the JellyHookAPI/jellyhookapi.py file.\nThen, add the Handlebars template in Jellyfin \u0026gt; Plugin \u0026gt; Webhook \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Generic Destination\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd finally, build and run the docker image.\nAll these steps are explained in the JellyHookAPI/README of the JellyHookAPI folder.\nDiscord Webhook To add a Discord webhook:\nclick on \u0026ldquo;Add Discord Destination\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Webhook Name\u0026rdquo;: what you want \u0026ldquo;Webhook Url\u0026rdquo;: the discord webhook url \u0026ldquo;Notification type\u0026rdquo;: if you want to receive notification when a new item (movie/tv show/\u0026hellip;) is added, check \u0026ldquo;Item Added\u0026rdquo; or when a user is locked out (because of too much wrong password during connection), check \u0026ldquo;User Locked Out\u0026rdquo; or when a user is created/deleted, when a password is changed, \u0026hellip; (for every use case check this file), check \u0026ldquo;Authentication *\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;User *\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;User Filter\u0026rdquo;: personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t check anything here \u0026ldquo;Item Type\u0026rdquo;: check everything (depending on your webhook template) except \u0026ldquo;Send All Properties\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Template\u0026rdquo;: (copy and paste the content) discord-item.handlebars discord-users-locked-out.handlebars discord-users.handlebars \u0026ldquo;Avatar Url\u0026rdquo;: just change the avatar profile picture directly on Discord \u0026ldquo;Webhook Username\u0026rdquo;: should not be empty, but you can write what you want, the real username is defined directly in Discord \u0026ldquo;Mention Type\u0026rdquo;: I never used this \u0026ldquo;Embed Color\u0026rdquo;: color of the embedded message Then click save.\nMicrosoft Teams Webhook To add a Microsoft Teams webhook:\nclick on \u0026ldquo;Add a Generic Destination\u0026rdquo; check the steps for Discord, it\u0026rsquo;s the same \u0026ldquo;Template\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;Item Added\u0026rdquo;: teams-items.handlebars \u0026ldquo;User Locked Out\u0026rdquo;: teams-users-locked-out.handlebars \u0026ldquo;User\u0026rdquo;: teams-users.handlebars Old method WhatsApp Webhook (Old method - please refer to the Global Webhook section for the new (and better) method.)\nTo add a WhatsApp webhook:\nNot as easy as the others.\nYou need to connect your WhatsApp account as if you were logging on WhatsApp Web.\nTo achieve this, you\u0026rsquo;re going to use another docker-compose to self-host a WhatsApp HTTP API. I\u0026rsquo;m using this API.\nFollow these steps:\n$ cd /opt/chill $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garnajee/home-server/master/docker-compose-whatsapp.yml $ docker-compose --file docker-compose-whatsapp.yml up -d Note that the docker-compose I provided is not really optimized, you can add environment variable to better configure. You can check the documentation here.\nFeel free to modify and perhaps make a pull request!\nThen follow the official from step 3 to 5. For any further information, like the id of a contact or a group, please read the documentation.\nGo back to Jellyfin \u0026gt; Plugin \u0026gt; Webhook:\nclick on \u0026ldquo;Add Generic Form Destination\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Webhook Url\u0026rdquo;: the internal docker ip, if you don\u0026rsquo;t change anything in the docker-compose it should be: http://10.10.66.200:3000/api/sendText then check what you want depending on the template Then copy and paste the template you want:\n\u0026ldquo;Item Added\u0026rdquo;: whatsapp-items.handlebars (very basic) \u0026ldquo;User created/deleted\u0026rdquo;: whatsapp-basic-user.handlebars And finally you need to 2 Headers:\n\u0026ldquo;Key\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;accept\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Value\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;application/json\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Key\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;Content-Type\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Value\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;application/json\u0026rdquo; Please note, that we cannot send images with this API (it\u0026rsquo;s a paid feature).\n(If you want to send the poster, refer to the new method (Global Webhook).)\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it, you can save.\nNew method WhatsApp Webhook Please refer to the whatsapp-api/README to install and configure this API.\nThis API allows you to send much more things than the previous one.\nFake Ratio If you need to fake your upload in order to have a ratio \u0026gt;= 1, you can use Ratio.py.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend using this indefinitely, please consider sharing to the community.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/home-server/","summary":"A guide to create your perfect home server.","title":"Home Server"},{"content":" warning\nDisclaimer: The author and contributors do not claim ownership of any services listed or used in this repository and are not legally responsible for any improper or illegal use.

To avoid any further conflict, just create it before running the docker-compose.\nHere the subnet is 10.10.66.0/24. If you want to change this by something else, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to modify the docker-compose.yml too.

For example, you can add a link to Jellyseerr.\nTo do that, you need to add this line in the Jellyfin\u0026rsquo;s volume field in the docker-compose file:\n- ${BASE}/jellyfin/web-config.json:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/config.json And add the web-config.json file in your /opt/chill/jellyfin/ folder.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see that the docker path is not the same as in the documentation. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but that\u0026rsquo;s the only way I can get it to work.\nRead more here.\nJellyseerr Follow the steps, it\u0026rsquo;s easy.\nSign in with your Jellyfin account and make sure to use the jellyfin internal docker ip address for the \u0026ldquo;Jellyfin URL\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen Syncing Librairies, uncheck \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo;.\nThen, add your radarr and sonarr server (still with the internal docker ip address).\nOnce this is done, you can sync Jellyfin users with Jellyseerr, so that they have the same account for Jellyfin and Jellyseerr.\nFor sonarr server settings, make sure to check Season folder.\nBonus Don\u0026rsquo;t want to use a reverse proxy?\nYou can use a VPN:\nOfficial Synology VPN package -\u0026gt; need to open port on your router And if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to open port on your router (or if you can\u0026rsquo;t):\nTailscale on Synology CloudFlare Tunnel warning\nPay attention to not use CloudFlare tunnel for Jellyfin streaming, you may be banned for breaking TOS.\nWebhooks I provide some webhooks for Jellyfin. These webhooks are used for:\nAny API (WhatsApp in my case) Discord Microsoft Teams First of all, you need to install the Jellyfin plugin called \u0026ldquo;Webhooks\u0026rdquo;: Jellyfin \u0026gt; Dashboard \u0026gt; Plugins \u0026gt; Catalog \u0026gt; Webhook\nThen, you need to restart Jellyfin:\n$ cd /opt/chill/ $ docker-compose restart jellyfin Now, go back to Jellyfin in the Plugins tab and click on Webhook.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Server Url\u0026rdquo; is your Jellyfin URL. If you expose it on internet, it\u0026rsquo;s something like this: https://jellyfin.yourdomainname.com/\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a domain name, Jellyfin will not be able to display images (posters) in the Discord/Teams webhooks.\nmy text\nFake Ratio If you need to fake your upload stats on (semi-)private indexers, in order to have a ratio \u0026gt;= 1.\nwarning\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend using this indefinitely, please consider sharing to the community.\nYou can use Ratio.py.\nTo use this python script in a secure way, you can add it in the transmission-openvpn docker (already running). That way, everything will go through the vpn.\n$ cd /opt/chill $ mkdir -p transovpn/ratio volumes: - ${BASE}/transovpn/config:/config - ${DOWNLOADS}:/data + - ${BASE}/transovpn/ratio/:/home/ $ cd
